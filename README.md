# Abstract

I give an overview of the current landscape and the standard methods used to analyse LVK data. I then highlight the main differences and challenges presented by upcoming data in the 3G + LISA era, with a focus on how the current standard methods will scale for this era. Finally, I discuss two key technological advancements that have been driving progress towards addressing these challenges: machine learning and the introduction of GPUs.
